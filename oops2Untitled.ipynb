    "15.Composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs by:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Promoting Modularity: Composition allows you to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components. Each component encapsulates a specific set of functionalities, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Facilitating Code Reusability: Composition promotes code reuse by enabling the reuse of existing components in different contexts. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can compose objects to create new functionalities, reducing code duplication and development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Encouraging Loose Coupling: Composition encourages loose coupling between components by promoting interaction through well-defined interfaces. This reduces dependencies between objects, making it easier to modify and extend the codebase without impacting other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Simplifying Testing and Debugging: Composition allows you to isolate and test individual components independently, making it easier to identify and fix bugs. This simplifies the testing and debugging process, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.\n",

    "17.The concept of \"aggregation\" in composition refers to a relationship where one class (the containing class) contains instances of other classes (the composed objects) as parts of its internal state. Aggregation differs from simple composition in that it represents a \"has-a\" relationship where the containing class owns or has control over the composed objects, but the composed objects can exist independently of the containing class.\n",
